    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      After completing my Bachelor of Commerce in Accounting at Ryerson in 2018,
      I went on to receive my CPA in 2021. But my passion for technology led me
      to pursue a Bachelor of Computing (Honours) with co-op at Queenâ€™s
      University. I have hands-on experience in designing, developing, and
      testing web and mobile applications using React, Typescript, JavaScript,
      and CSS.
